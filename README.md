# Microservices communication conpect
Concept prove to implementation nestjs microservices - scenario simulated

## Main goal
Demonstrate to squad how we can implement a communication between services and microservices using a transports adapters via TCP protocol with message transmission and event emits. Another way is hybrid application's - API REST + TCP calls internally.

## Technologies
* Nestjs (microservice way)
* Default TCP transport
* API Rest to trigger events and send messages
